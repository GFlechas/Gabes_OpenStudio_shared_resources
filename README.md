# Gabes_OpenStudio_shared_resources
 This repository holds the notebooks and scripts I put together as I figure out how to work with OpenStudio and its Python bindings.

## Purpose
I'm trying to comment my code and leave details that might be helpful to others working with OpenStudio. I couldn't find any public repositories that use the Python OpenStudio bindings. It's just different enough from the Ruby based documentation I've had a hard time figuring out the differences. I've pieced together enough to get rolling and have learned enough to start looking at how ruby measures interact with models and immitate the behavior with the Python bindings.

So far, readers should find code that reads in a .OSM, can translate it to the current version of OpenStudio, make some modifications, and save it as a new model. 

I'm hoping this will save a few other people some time and headache.
